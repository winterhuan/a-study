    "english": "Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications beyond what's offered by the operating system. It sits between applications and infrastructure, handling concerns like messaging (Kafka), caching (Redis), authentication, logging, and data transformation. Middleware enables loose coupling, reusability, and separation of concerns in distributed architectures.",
    "chinese": "中间件是为应用程序提供超出操作系统功能的通用服务和能力的软件。它位于应用程序和基础设施之间,处理消息传递(Kafka)、缓存(Redis)、认证、日志和数据转换等关注点。中间件在分布式架构中实现松耦合、可重用性和关注点分离。"
