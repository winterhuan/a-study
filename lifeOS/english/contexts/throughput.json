    "english": "Throughput measures the rate at which a system processes data or completes operations, typically expressed as records/second, bytes/second, or transactions/second. In stream processing systems like Flink and Spark, throughput is a critical performance metric that depends on parallelism, resource allocation, and backpressure handling. High throughput indicates efficient resource utilization and system capacity.",
    "chinese": "吞吐量衡量系统处理数据或完成操作的速率,通常以记录数/秒、字节数/秒或事务数/秒表示。在Flink和Spark等流处理系统中,吞吐量是关键性能指标,取决于并行度、资源分配和反压处理。高吞吐量表明资源利用效率高和系统容量充足。"
